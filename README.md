# Network R01 Functional Alignment Analyses
## Authors: Chris Iyer, Sunjae Shim

This repo will contain code for the following analyses run on our dense neuroimaging Network R01 project data:
- Deriving connectivity matrices for each rest session (each subject undergoes 10-12 4-min rest sessions)
- Assessing within-subject reliability of these rest session connectomes
- Deriving connectivity-based Shared Response Models (SRM; [Chen et al. 2015](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2015/file/b3967a0e938dc2a6340e258630febd5a-Paper.pdf); [Nastase et al. 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920303517?via%3Dihub#bib92); [Guntupalli et al. 2018](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006120))
- Using these SRMs to decode task states on cognitive control tasks with attention to subject-specific functional topographies.
